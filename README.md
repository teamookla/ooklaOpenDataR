## Installation

You can install the released version of ooklaOpenDataR from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ooklaOpenDataR")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("teamookla/ooklaOpenDataR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
# library(ooklaOpenDataR)
## basic example code
```

up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub\!
