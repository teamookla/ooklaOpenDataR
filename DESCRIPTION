Description: This dataset provides global fixed broadband and mobile 
    (cellular) network performance metrics in zoom level 16 web mercator 
    tiles (approximately 610.8 meters by 610.8 meters at the equator). 
    Data is provided in both Shapefile format as well as Apache Parquet 
    with geometries represented in Well Known Text (WKT) projected in EPSG:4326. 
    Download speed, upload speed, and latency are collected via the Speedtest 
    by Ookla applications for Android and iOS and averaged for each tile. 
    Measurements are filtered to results containing GPS-quality location accuracy.
